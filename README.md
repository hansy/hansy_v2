yarn
yarn run server

### Available Commands

* `yarn run build` - Builds assets (sass, js, fonts, images) and runs `hugo`
* `yarn run build:preview` - The same as `build`, but runs `hugo --buildDrafts --buildFuture`
* `yarn run server` - Runs BrowserSync and watches for changes, running `build` when changes are detected
