Hi, I'm Hans! I'm a full-stack product developer. I like building APIs in [Ruby/Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) or [Crystal/Amber](https://amberframework.org/), and using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) on the front-end. I'm a fan of minimalism, side projects, movies, and video games. I'm always down for collaboration or hackathons, so don't be shy to say hello!
