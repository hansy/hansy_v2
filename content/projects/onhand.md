onHand is a scheduling widget that can be embedded into any website to facilitate appointment booking. The website owner can specify day/time availabilities as well as sync their Google Calendar schedule.

The initial, projected target audience was freelancers; however, the majority of website traffic turned out to be from [Shopify](https://shopify.com), so the app pivoted slightly to cater to small, online businesses.
